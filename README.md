# Bayesian Networks tutorial

This is a mini workshop for learning Bayesian Networks in R

It is heavily based on the `bnlearn` package by Marco scutari.

The workshop is based on jupyter notebooks and can be viewed as a presentation using RISE.

I recommend taking it by loading binder!

To keep learning about `bnlearn` I recommend the original documentation and examples at http://bnlearn.com, and the excellent books by the author.
